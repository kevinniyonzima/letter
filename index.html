    <h1>Re: Eileen Dover applying to college</h1>

    <p>Dear Eileen,</p>

    <p>Thank you for your recent application to join us at the Faculty of Science at
        Université Génialissime<br/> to study for your PhD next year. I will answer
        your questions one by one, in the following sections.</p>
    
        <p><h3>Start dates</h3></p>
    
    <p>We are happy that you can start your studies with us at any time, but we prefer
        that you start at the<br/> beginning of a semester; the start dates for each
        semester are as follows:</p>
    
        <p><ol><li>First semester: September 9, 2016</li><br/>
        <li>Second semester: January 15, 2017</li><br/>
        <li>Third semester: May 2, 2017</li></ol></p>
    
        <p>Please let me know if this is right for you, and if so, which start date you
        prefer.<br/>
        You can find more information about important university dates on our website.
        </p>
    
        <p><h3>Study subjects</h3></p>
    
    <p>In the Faculty of Genius Sciences, we have a great openness in research, as long
         as the subjects fall<br/> within the field of science and technology. You seem
          like an intelligent and dedicated researcher, just the<br/> kind of person we
           would like to have on our team. That said, among the ideas you submitted, the
            ones<br/> that intrigued us the most are the following, in order of priority:
        </p>
    
        <p><ul><li>Turning <sup>h2o</sup> into wine, and the health benefits of
            resveratrol (<sup>C14H12O3</sup>).</li><br/>
        
        <li>Measuring the effect on performance of funk bass players at
            temperatures above <sup>30°C</sup> (<sup>86°F</sup>), when audience size
            increases exponentially</li><br/>
        
        <li>(effect from 3 × 10<sup>3</sup>increasing to 3 × 10<sup>4</sup>.)<br/>
            Constructions in HTML and CSS for the representation of musical scores.</ul></li>
        </p>
        
        <p>Can you provide us with more information on each of these topics, including 
            the expected duration of the<br/> research, the staff and other resources
             needed, and anything else we should know? Thank you.</p>
        
         <p>Please accept, Madam, the expression of my distinguished sentiments,<br/>
            Dr Eleanor Gaye
